# AQI-Prediction
AQI Prediction System 
Overview
This project predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) using Machine Learning (Linear Regression). It takes input features such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3 levels to predict AQI. The model is deployed using Flask, and the frontend is built with HTML & CSS for a user-friendly interface.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python 

Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression Model) 

Flask (Web Deployment) 

HTML, CSS (Frontend UI) 

Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing) 

How It Works
1Ô∏è‚É£ User inputs pollutant levels (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Model predicts the AQI using Linear Regression.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Flask serves the prediction on a simple web UI.

üìà Future Improvements
 Improve model accuracy with advanced ML techniques (Random Forest, XGBoost).

 Deploy on Heroku/AWS/GCP for cloud access.

 Integrate real-time AQI API for live predictions.
